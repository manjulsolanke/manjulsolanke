### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Manjul solanke. With over 10 years of experience in the IT industry, I am a DevOps Engineer, an enthusiast in Kubernetes, Automation and Cloud.

I currently work at GlobalLogic as a Consultant, helping partners to build high quality solutions using K8s on AWS Cloud.

My core technical skillset is in DevOps, but in recent years I've been most excited about
the efficiencies that DevOps tools like Kubernetes and infrastructure-as-code can accomplish for an
organization.
